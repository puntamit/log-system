# Frontend - log-system

## Setup (local dev)
1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Start dev server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
3. By default the frontend expects the backend API proxied at /api (same origin).
   In development, you can run backend on localhost:4000 and use a proxy in vite config or call full URL.
